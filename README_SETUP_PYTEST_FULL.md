## Additional Setup

This adds utilites etc so that we have our Full Stack Suite

- log folder and file need not be added as pytest.ini will create it.
- add results folder for use with special `conftest.py` file that will have CSV output of test results.
- add `config` and `utils` folders for utilities etc.
- add `00_setup` folder for tests of logging, config and add `conftest.py`.
